FAQ chat bot

Simple FAQ chat bot

Create a class in python (or a different object oriented language of your choice) that takes in free text from a user and provides a suitable response. This response will be based on a repository of questions and answers stored in a database. Please share your code along with clear instructions to test the bot with additional questions. Also share your answers to the questions below:

    Which algorithm did you use to match free text with questions in the repository? What were the reasons to select the algorithm?
    How would you measure accuracy? How would you improve accuracy?
    How would you deal with multiple users speaking with the same bot?

Please use the Q&A repository available at the following URL:
